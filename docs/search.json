    "text": "Research program\n\nGenerally, my research asks the question: Can transforming the self transform the world? I answer yes, but only if we think of self-transformation – or ‘askesis’ – as something more than an isolated, individual project whose political import, if it has one, starts and ends with the hope that many individual self-transformations will amount to a broader world-transformation.\nI aim to develop a sufficiently nuanced theory of what self-transformation has entailed and could entail in its political valences.  Properly understood, effective asceticism is always a collective undertaking in constant dialectical relation with broad economic and political structures/strategies and local, concrete institutions.\nThe title that I give to my general research agenda is “global political asceticisms.”  I undertake the global, contextual, and comparative study of organized systems for the training and modification of bodily and mental capacities.  Most recently, I have been exploring Gandhi’s ascetic activism and the ashram as an “ascetic technology” for the generation of anticolonial and anticapitalist political agency."

I hold a PhD in Government from Harvard University, where my dissertation was awarded the APSA Leo Strauss Award for Best Dissertation in Political Philosophy.\nMy research and teaching expertise are in 20th century political thought and ancient political thought, and I study how ‘ethics’ and ‘politics’ intersect in domains such as labour, education, self-cultivation, physical training, and decolonization. I am also a specialist in the thought of Michel Foucault.\nMy questions: What global variations can we see in self-transformational struggles, and what insights can these give us for thinking domination and freedom in the 21st century? How, if at all, can changing the self change the world? And is this question itself a neoliberal trap?"
