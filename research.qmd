Generally, my research asks the question: Can transforming the self transform the world? I answer yes, but only if we think of self-transformation – or ‘askesis’ – as something more than an isolated, individual project whose political import, if it has one, starts and ends with the hope that many individual self-transformations will amount to a broader world-transformation.

I aim to develop a sufficiently nuanced theory of what self-transformation has entailed and could entail in its political valences.  Properly understood, effective asceticism is always a collective undertaking in constant dialectical relation with broad economic and political structures and local, concrete institutions. Most recently, this has taken form in a series of explorations of Gandhi’s ascetic anticolonial activism.

**In addition** to the above listed works, I currently have essays under review on the following themes:

1.  Anticolonial ethics of self-cultivation and asceticism as anticolonial practice of liberation in thinkers such as Gandhi and Frederick Douglass (co-authored with Dimitri M’Bama)

2.  AI technology’s impact on translation as an intercultural practice, and the attendant loss of skills for mutual comprehension and global dialogue

3.  Inès Valdez’ work on racial capitalism, migration, and the failure of the left to meet the challenges of contemporary emancipatory democracy, in conversation with Frantz Fanon

4.  A historical survey of the moralization of wealth and poverty in the ancient world

These works serve as first studies towards a second book project that is tentatively entitled: *Social Domination and Political Asceticism: History, Theory, Strategy.*
