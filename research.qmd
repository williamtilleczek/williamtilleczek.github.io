Generally, my research asks the question: Can transforming the self transform the world? I answer yes, but only if we think of self-transformation – or ‘askesis’ – as something more than an isolated, individual project whose political import, if it has one, starts and ends with the hope that many individual self-transformations will amount to a broader world-transformation.

I aim to develop a sufficiently nuanced theory of what self-transformation has entailed and could entail in its political valences.  Properly understood, effective asceticism is always a collective undertaking in constant dialectical relation with broad economic and political structures and local, concrete institutions.

**In addition** to the above listed works, I am currently at work on an essay exploring asceticism as an anti-colonial practice of liberation, co-authored with Dimitri M’Bama.  I have also recently completed essays on Foucault and Arendt, on poverty in Classical Athens, and have begun research for a second book project that is tentatively entitled: *Social Domination and Political Asceticism: History, Theory, Strategy.*
