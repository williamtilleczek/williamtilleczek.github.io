Generally, my research asks the question: Can transforming the self transform the world? I answer yes, but only if we think of self-transformation – or ‘askesis’ – as something more than an isolated, individual project whose political import, if it has one, starts and ends with the hope that many individual self-transformations will amount to a broader world-transformation.

I aim to develop a sufficiently nuanced theory of what self-transformation has entailed and could entail in its political valences.  Properly understood, effective asceticism is always a collective undertaking in constant dialectical relation with broad economic and political structures/strategies and local, concrete institutions.

The title that I give to my general research agenda is "global political asceticisms."  I undertake the global, contextual, and comparative study of organized systems for the training and modification of bodily and mental capacities.  Most recently, I have been exploring Gandhi’s ascetic activism and the ashram as an "ascetic technology" for the generation of anticolonial and anticapitalist political agency.

**In addition** to the above listed works, I currently have essays under review on the following themes:

1.  Anticolonial ethics of self-cultivation and asceticism as anticolonial practice of liberation in thinkers such as Gandhi and Frederick Douglass (co-authored with Dimitri M’Bama)

2.  AI technology’s impact on translation as an intercultural practice, and the attendant loss of skills for mutual comprehension and global dialogue

3.  Inés Valdez’ work on racial capitalism, migration, and the failure of the left to meet the challenges of contemporary emancipatory democracy, in conversation with Frantz Fanon

4.  A historical survey of the moralization of wealth and poverty in the ancient world

These works serve as first studies towards a second book project that is tentatively entitled: *Social Domination and Political Asceticism: History, Theory, Strategy.*
