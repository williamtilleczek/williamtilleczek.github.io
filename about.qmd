### **More info**

I have also held positions as SSHRC Postdoctoral Fellow at McGill University, where I was a member of the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/rgcs/" target="_blank">Research Group on Constitutional Studies</a>. In 2023, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Deep Springs College. I hold a PhD in Government from Harvard University, where my dissertation was awarded the <a href="https://politicalsciencenow.com/william-tilleczek-receives-the-2024-leo-strauss-award-for-powers-of-practice-michel-foucault-and-the-politics-of-asceticism/" target="_blank">APSA Leo Strauss Award</a> for Best Dissertation in Political Philosophy.

My research and teaching expertise are in 20th century political thought and ancient political thought, and I study how ‘ethics’ and ‘politics’ intersect in domains such as labour, education, self-cultivation, physical training, and decolonization. I am also a specialist in the thought of Michel Foucault.

My questions: What global variations can we see in self-transformational struggles, and what insights can these give us for thinking domination and freedom in the 21st century? How, if at all, can changing the self change the world? And is this question itself a neoliberal trap?
