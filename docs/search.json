    "text": "Generally, my research asks the question: Can transforming the self transform the world? I answer yes, but only if we think of self-transformation – or ‘askesis’ – as something more than an isolated, individual project whose political import, if it has one, starts and ends with the hope that many individual self-transformations will amount to a broader world-transformation.\nI aim to develop a sufficiently nuanced theory of what self-transformation has entailed and could entail in its political valences.  Properly understood, effective asceticism is always a collective undertaking in constant dialectical relation with broad economic and political structures/strategies and local, concrete institutions.\nThe title that I give to my general research agenda is “global political asceticisms.”  I undertake the global, contextual, and comparative study of organized systems for the training and modification of bodily and mental capacities.  Most recently, I have been exploring Gandhi’s ascetic activism and the ashram as an “ascetic technology” for the generation of anticolonial and anticapitalist political agency."

At Deep Springs College, I designed and taught seminars as a visiting professor.  Previously, I had the chance to teach four times for Prof. Michael Sandel at Harvard where, as a teaching fellow, I guided discussion sections and provided short supplementary lectures.\nI take pride in challenging students to move beyond their limitations, while giving them the support they need to do so, all in an environment of mutual respect and collaboration.  One of my students stated my goal better than I could: “a subtle but ever-present mixture of high respect for his students in our current form and deep faith in their ability to improve/elevate our thinking.”"

    "text": "Deep Springs College\nSOC204: Hannah Arendt and Simone Weil: Work and Politics (Deep Springs College), Winter 2023.\nDescription: This class brings together two contemporary philosophers and social critics, Simone Weil (1909-1943) and Hannah Arendt (1906-1975), both of whom abhorred the totalitarianisms of their time, reflected on the possibilities of a post-Marxist politics, and theorized the meaning of labour in human life.  Weil, a French mystic, ascetic, activist, and philosopher, was deeply dedicated to understanding working-class life and violence in its many forms.  Arendt, a German-born philosopher (or rather, as she herself preferred, political theorist), wrote much of her work in the United States during and after the Second World War and offered a wealth of theoretical tools to understand human labour and work as well as freedom and political action.  Our goal will be a “lecture croisée” of these two oeuvres oriented around two major thematics: (1) Forms of human activity and their relation to political life; (2) Marxism and its major nodal points of revolution and freedom.  Along the way we will also think about ancient Greece, the tradition of political thought, colonial violence, and our own neoliberal economic reality.  Readings are a combination of major works from each author (The Need for Roots and The Human Condition), essays and occasional pieces (e.g. “The Iliad, or the Poem of Force” and “Revolution and Freedom”), as well as contextualizing readings from theorists who inspired or were inspired by Weil and Arendt (Karl Marx, Frantz Fanon, Albert Camus, Danielle Allen).\nHUM010: Introduction to Ancient Greek Language & Literature (Deep Springs College), Winter 2023.\nDescription: This course is intended for students who have completed their initial study of Greek grammar (e.g. by completing an introductory course sequence) and who have some experience reading original (viz., un-adapted) Greek prose.  The transition from textbook study to the engagement with real Greek authors can be a difficult one, and this course aims to facilitate this transition by combining continued reading of a complete Greek text with a rapid but comprehensive review of Attic Greek morpho-syntax.  Our primary goal is to read Plato’s Gorgias in its entirety, in order to become familiar with idiomatic Greek and to expand our vocabulary through repeated exposure to Plato’s prose.  Our secondary goal is to revisit challenging elements of Greek grammar through a review of Louise Pratt’s The Essentials of Greek Grammar as well as via ad-hoc review of difficult points that arise during our reading.  Class will consist primarily of the close reading of Plato’s text, a specific section of which will be assigned in advance of each class.  Students are expected to work through this text in advance (e.g. look up and record all unknown vocabulary, decipher any challenging syntactic constructions), and be prepared to translate the text with the help of their notes – but without a prepared translation – ‘live’ in class.  We will always read the Greek out loud before translating to gain familiarity with the sounds and the rhythm of the language.  While our main goal is to improve our Greek reading fluency, we will take time to discuss Plato’s views on rhetoric, ethics, and politics as raised in this fascinating Socratic dialogue."

    "text": "Bio\nOriginally from Sudbury, ON, I spent my youth and early adulthood in Canada. \nMy first postsecondary degree was a combined BA Honours at Dalhousie University and the University of King’s College in Halifax, NS.  There I studied in English Literature (I had a particular interest in Shakespeare and poetry) and Contemporary Studies, one of King’s College’s flagship interdisciplinary programs that studies the modern world by combining history of science, political theory, philosophy, literature, and film studies, among other things.  I also received a minor in Classics, and took a special interest in Greek language and literature, and above all in Homer, Plato, Aristotle, and the Hellenistic thinkers.\nI then moved to Toronto, ON in 2014 to complete an MA in Political Science, where I was schooled in the political theory canon and undertook targeted studies of Plato and the post-Marxist tradition.  Before going on to begin my PhD, I took a gap year during which I worked at a yoga studio, undertook a course of study to be certified as a yoga teacher, and was introduced to the philosophy and practice of the Yogic and Buddhist traditions.  This course of study and practice continues to shape my research.\nIn 2016 I moved to Cambridge, MA to begin my PhD and MA in Government at Harvard University.  From 2016-2022, I completed my dissertation, taught in Harvard’s General Education Program, and intensively studied various languages alongside my course work. \nMy interest in global languages and cultures – and especially, via Foucault, in the French language – has significantly shaped the course of my career and has instilled in me an international and comparative approach to research.  I have reading knowledge of Latin and advanced knowledge of Ancient Greek (including Greek prose composition), and I am fluent in German and French.  Currently I am having a lot of fun advancing my knowledge of Modern Greek at a high-intermediate level and my knowledge of classical Sanskrit.\nMy love of French language(s) and culture(s) brought me to spend a good deal of time over the summers of my PhD studying French in Quebec (Montréal, Chicoutimi, Québec City), and to spend the year of 2019-2020 studying and undertaking doctoral research at the Ecole Normale Supérieure and the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris.\nAfter completing my PhD in 2022, I taught at Deep Springs College (California), and am now thrilled to be undertaking postdoctoral research in the bilingual environment of Montréal under the supervision of Professor William Clare Roberts (McGill).  Since 2022 I have also had the great privilege of research/study stays in Greece (at the European Cultural Center of Delphi), France (at the Bibliothèque du Saulchoir), and Germany (at the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin’s Center for Social Critique).\nMost importantly, since 2021 I have been one of Eleanor Tilleczek’s very proud and grateful parents."
