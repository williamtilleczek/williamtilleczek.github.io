Generally, my research asks the question: Can transforming the self transform the world? I answer yes, but only if we think of self-transformation – or ‘askesis’ – as something more than an isolated, individual project whose political import, if it has one, starts and ends with the hope that many individual self-transformations will amount to a broader world-transformation.

I aim to develop a sufficiently nuanced theory of what self-transformation has entailed and could entail in its political valences.  Properly understood, effective asceticism is always a collective undertaking in constant dialectical relation with broad economic and political structures/strategies and local, concrete institutions.

The title that I give to my general research agenda is "global political asceticisms."  I undertake the global, contextual, and comparative study of organized systems for the training and modification of bodily and mental capacities.  Most recently, I have been exploring Gandhi’s ascetic activism and the ashram as an "ascetic technology" for the generation of anticolonial and anticapitalist political agency.

### [Articles under review]{style="color: #b76e5f"}

I currently have works under review on the following themes:

1.  Anticolonial ethics of self-cultivation and asceticism as anticolonial practice in thinkers such as Gandhi and Frederick Douglass (co-authored with Dimitri M’Bama)

2.  Inés Valdez’ work on racial capitalism, migration, and the failure of the left to meet the challenges of contemporary emancipatory democracy

3.  A historical survey of the moralization of wealth and poverty in the ancient world

These works serve as first studies towards a second book project that is tentatively entitled: *A Comparative History of Political Asceticisms*.
